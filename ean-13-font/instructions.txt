--

This font can be used to create an EAN-13 barcode which is a superset of the
UPC-A barcode.

How to use

EAN-13 has 3 symbol sets A, B, and C. It looks like the following:

*XXXXXX#CCCCCC*

* start/end bar (as common for Code 39)
# middle bar
X a symbol of set A or B (see below)
C a symbol of set C

Symbol sets

The symbol sets are placed on an international keyboard layout:

Number row: 1234567890
Middle character row: asdfghjkl;
Top character row: qwertyuiop

The first digit of an EAN-13 barcode does not directly correspond to a symbol.
It determines which symbol set for the following 6 digits is to be used.
The following listing shows the symbol set combinations for the starting digits:

AABABB
AABBAB
AABBBA
ABAABB
ABBAAB
ABBBAA
ABABAB
ABABBA
ABBABA

If the starting digit is 0, or if you want to encode a UPC-A, only use symbol
set A.
